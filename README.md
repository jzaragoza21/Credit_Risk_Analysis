# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this exercise was to apply different machine learning models to solve the real world challenge of credit card risk. In doing so, we tested credit risk using the following machine learning techniques:

 - Naive Random Oversampling
 - SMOTE Oversampling
 - Undersampling
 - SMOTEENN
 - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
 - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
